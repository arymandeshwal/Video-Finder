# Video-Finder
It selects videos from YouTube to which best match your query and has quality content instead of clickbait.
The main idea behind this project is that a person shouldn't get side tracked by recommendations on YouTube and waste hours on useless videos.
Instructions:
1. Run main.py
2. Go to your localhost on your browser to see top 5 videos.
